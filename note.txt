create a folder 'templates' in the same layer of django project(with a manage.py inside)
draw all the html files into \templates
in settings.py enter 'DIRS': [BASE_DIR,'templates'], in TEMPLATES
in views def index(request)
	return render(request,'index.html')


about urls:
in the urls.py in blog_generator(created by developer for the projects):
urlpatterns=[
    path('', views.index, name="index"),#the url specified to the homepage
    path('login', views.user_login, name="login"),
    path('signup', views.user_signup, name="signup"),
    path('logout', views.user_logout, name="logout")

]

in the urls.py in app(created by django):
urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('', include('blog_generator.urls'))#go into the blog_generator folder and look for urls

how to run server?
in the terminal:python manage.py runserver

how to create admin?


enter by \admin

type in the terminal

python manage.py createsuperuser


The error no such table: auth_user occurs because you are trying to create a user before the database tables have been created. Django's user system requires specific tables to exist in your database (like auth_user) to store the superuser credentials.
To fix this, you must apply the initial migrations to set up your database schema first. Run these two commands in order:
1. Apply Migrations
This command creates the necessary tables (including the missing auth_user table) in your SQLite database.
powershell
python manage.py migrate


2. Create the Superuser
Now that the tables exist, you can successfully create your admin account:
powershell
python manage.py createsuperuser




the logic of sign up:

<form action="POST">:to safely pass the info in the form to the backend

def signup(request):
#receive the data from frontend

username = request.POST['username'] 'username'is defined in the form in the frontend 

how to create a user?
in views.py: from django.contrib.auth.models import User
user=User.object.create_user(username,password,email)#the features passed from request.POST
user.save()
#login as soon as signup completed and redirect to homepage
from django.shortcuts import render,redirect
login(request,user)
return redirect('/')

login logic:authenticate then login
check out if the username match the password,using authentication
from django.contrib.auth import authenticate
user = authenticate(request, username=username,password=password)
if user is not None:
            login(request,user)
            return redirect('/')

how to logout?

in views.py

from django.contrib.auth import logout
def user_logout(request):
    logout(request)
    return redirect('/')
 
how to limit the users to login page when they do not login?

in views.py

from django.contrib.auth.decorators import login_required
@login_required
def index(request):
    return render(request,'index.html')

type:LOGIN_URL = 'login' in the very bottom
